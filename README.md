Om-Noms-chat-box
================

A chat messenger created with a node.js chat server and client 

Must specify your ip address and port you are using to use the chatbox. The server is the chat.js file - it can 
only be used if your public ip address points to your private server ip (i.e. port forwarding is set up).
